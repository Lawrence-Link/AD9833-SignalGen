# AD9833-SignalGen
This is a simple Signal Generator built with AD9833, atmega328au.

I'm going to share some of the building experience online or in my personal blog (Which is in Simplified Chinese).

The whole idea of this project were inspired by Cezar Chrilla's [How to Build Your Own Function Generator Using Analog Devicesâ€™ AD9833](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/how-to-DIY-waveform-generator-analog-devices-ad9833-ATmega328p/)

The circuit part is almost the same and the only difference is the firmware, and it uses 2 awesome libs:
The first one is [MD_AD9833](https://github.com/MajicDesigns/MD_AD9833)
the second one is [Encoder](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html)

I've already complied the files, and you can upload it to your board easily.
I also recommend to see GreatScott's [Function/Waveform Generator || DIY or Buy](https://youtu.be/Y1KE8eAC9Bk), he made a arduino nano version of this.

Have fun!
